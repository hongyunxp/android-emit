Epidemic Moblie Information Transfer (EMIT) is a p2p-system which uses epidemic models to disseminate information in adventurous communication scenarios such as spontaneously and opportunistic networks.


An epidemic of information can be preconfigured to access distant network partitions by using various spreading and termination strategies which are influenced by the attributes of each node:

  * Communication interfaces
  * CPU and memory capabilities
  * Network-topology
  * Geographical mobility
  * Locations / Routes
  * Social data



Each node consists of following components:

  * Profile
  * Discovery
  * Transfer
  * Repository
  * Interference-Machine


The core modules are platform independent Java code where as the GUI is android specific.

The discovery and transfer descriptors are defined in XML.
